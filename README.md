context-color
=============

:rainbow: To each context its own shell color

Description
-----------

`context-color` is a simple script that, when executed, outputs a color based
on a command output's hash.

For example, once installed somewhere in your `$PATH`, it allows you to do
things like this:

```bash
export PS1="$(context-color -p)$PS1\[\e[0m\]"
```

(where `--prompt/-p` is the switch so that the color is escaped for prompts,
and `\[\e[0m\]` the escape sequence to reset color)

By default, the command used to generate the hash is `whoami; hostname`.  If
you would just want the color to change according to the hostname, you would
change the `$CONTEXT` variable environment (`export CONTEXT="hostname"`) or
simply use the `--context/-c` option (`context-color -c "hostname"`).


Install
-------

Something in those lines should do it:

```bash
cd .local/bin/
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ramnes/context-color/master/context-color
chmod a+x context-color
```

In order to use context-color for customizing your prompt by default, you need to add the script `context-color` to your PATH and modify your .bashrc files (on each host) with your customized new `PS1` variable. If you want this change to be applied system-wide on one host, you must change your `/etc/bashrc` (Redhat and friends) or `/etc/bash.bashrc` (Debian/Ubuntu) or `/etc/bash.bashrc.local` (Suse and others).

Example
=======

Let the old PS1 definiton then add at the end of the .bashrc file (assuming `context-color` is at `/usr/local/bin/context-color`):
```
if [ -x /usr/local/bin/context-color ]; then # check if the script exists
        PS1="$(context-color -p)$PS1\[\e[0m\]" # wrap $PS1 with context-color change
fi
```


Usage
-----

```
usage: $PROGNAME [OPTIONS]

Print a color sequence based on different context informations.

OPTIONS:
    --help, -h          Print this help.
    --background, -b    Use a background sequence rather than foreground.
    --prompt, -p        Declare the sequence as non-printable for prompts.

    --context <command>, -c <command>
                        Define the context command on which result the color
                        will be generated.
                        The default context is "whoami; hostname".
```
